# Overview of how to run 16s 

Steps: 
- Download this full folder to your computer
- Open the directory and copy your ab1 files into this directory in a subfolder named "files"
- You're just going to be running one script - the blast.bash file from your terminal
- Open your terminal and cd to this directory 
- Run sh blast.bash from the terminal 


Notes 
- if you don't have anaconda, blast, seqtk, R and python downloaded on your personal laptop, I will have to run the code for you - (we could make this into a package @Luke?)
